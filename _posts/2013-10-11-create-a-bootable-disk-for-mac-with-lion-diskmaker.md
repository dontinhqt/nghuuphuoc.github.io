Yesterday, I upgraded my iMac to MacOS Mavericks Gold Master. Most of development tools such as PHP Storm, WebStorm are working fine.
But I realized that some of libraries/tools are not compatible with this MacOS version.
And this morning, I decided to reinstall the Mountain Lion.

As usual, we can use the built-in __Disk Utility__ to create a bootable USB or hard drive. In this article, I will show you how to do it
with another free, friendly software named [Lion DiskMaker](http://liondiskmaker.com).

* Download [Lion DiskMaker](http://liondiskmaker.com)

> At the time of writing this, Lion DiskMaker supports MacOS 10.6/7/8

* Copy the Lion DiskMaker to your _Applications_ directory.

* Run the application. Choose the MacOS version which you want to create a boot disk for.

* In the next step, click the _Select and Install file_ button and choose the installer file.

* In the next step, click the _Create a boot disk_ button.

* In the next step, choose the disk that you want to store the installer.

* Wait while Lion DiskMaker does its job.

* After the process completed, click the _Quit_ button. You can click the _Open Startup Disk Preference_ button to choose the Startup disk.

After performing the steps above, my Mountain Lion installer are created on external drive as following:

So, how easy and convenient Lion DiskMarker does for me!

Now, the next step is that restart the Mac, drink a cup of coffee, and wait for the installation to complete.

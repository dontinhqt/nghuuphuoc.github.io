Yesterday, I upgraded my iMac to MacOS Mavericks Gold Master. Most of development tools such as PHP Storm, WebStorm are working fine.
But I realized that some of libraries/tools are not compatible with this MacOS version.
And this morning, I decided to reinstall the Mountain Lion.

As usual, we can use the built-in __Disk Utility__ to create a bootable USB or hard drive. In this article, I will show you how to do it
with another free, friendly software named [Lion DiskMaker](http://liondiskmaker.com).

1. Download [Lion DiskMaker](http://liondiskmaker.com)

> At the time of writing this, Lion DiskMaker supports MacOS 10.6/7/8

1. Copy the Lion DiskMaker to your _Applications_ directory.

1. Run the application. Choose the MacOS version which you want to create a boot disk for.

1. After the process completed, click the _Quit_ button. You can click the _Open Startup Disk Preference_ button to choose the Startup disk.

After performing the steps above, my Mountain Lion installer are created on external drive as following:

So, how easy and convenient Lion DiskMarker does for me!

Now, the next step is that restart the Mac, drink a cup of coffee, and wait for the installation to complete.
